You should have the following folder layout
finalcomp2/
├── Cargo.toml
├── message.txt         # Input plaintext file
└── src/
    └── main.rs

Make sure your Raspberry Pi has the following installed (run these commands in terminal):
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev

Install rust by running these cmds:
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env

Then build the project by first navigating into the project directory 
(meaning you're in the finalcomp2 folder) and running the cmds:

cargo build --release

then you can run each cryptographic algorithm script by running these commands:
cargo run --release --bin AES128
cargo run --release --bin AES192
cargo run --release --bin AES256

to run perf test
sudo perf stat ./target/release/AES128
sudo perf stat ./target/release/AES192
sudo perf stat ./target/release/AES256

Change the size of the plaintext message file by copying and pasting the small, medium or large text file into message.txt
