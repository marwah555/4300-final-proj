You should have the following folder layout
finalcomp2/
├── Cargo.toml
├── message.txt         # Input plaintext file
└── src/
    └── main.rs

Make sure your Raspberry Pi has the following installed (run these commands in terminal):
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev

Install rust by running these cmds:
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env

Then build the project by first navigating into the project directory 
(meaning you're in the finalcomp2 folder) and running the cmd:

cargo build --release

run the test and perf test by running:
perf stat -e instructions,cycles,cache-misses,branches,branch-misses,cpu-clock,task-clock ./target/release/sw_benchmarks.

Change the AES bit size by changing the key size in main.rs. Save this. 
Change the size of the plaintext message file by copying and pasting the small, medium or large text file into message.txt
